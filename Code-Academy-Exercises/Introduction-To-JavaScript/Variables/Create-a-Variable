//This lesson shows how to create variables, assign values, and output their values to the console.

//The Create a variable Let lesson doesn't have a file here so I'm putting it in this file
let changeMe = true;
changeMe = false;
console.log(changeMe);

//This introduces the let variable type which indicates the variable value will be changed. Then it shows us how to change said variable.

//Again, no file for the Create a Variable: const exercise, so it's going here.

const entree = "Enchiladas";
console.log(entree);
entree = "Tacos";

//This shows how to set a constant "variable" and shows that once a constant is assigned it can't actually be changed.
